# compressors_comparison

This app uses some packages to compress an image file: [flutter_image_compress](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_image_compress), [flutter_native_image](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_native_image), [flutter_luban](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_luban), [image_compression](https://pub.dev/packages/image_compression), [image_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker), and [image](https://pub.dev/packages/image). After comparing these packages, I can say `flutter_image_compress` is the best tool to compress images so far but it works for NO Web only, otherwise you can use `image`.
